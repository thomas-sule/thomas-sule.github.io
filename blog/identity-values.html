      <h4>
        Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration
      </h4>

        <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
        Recently I had a football game that I was giving my brother a ride to and I had previously been annoyed that he‚Äôd been making me late when I was giving him rides so I told him to be ready on time. He was running late and made a snide comment telling me to calm down which pushed me over the edge and I drove off without him. I felt like he wasn't respecting me when I had told him to be ready on time as I wasn't happy being late. It felt unfair that I was ready and had to wait another 10 minutes for him to be ready. Looking back on it I think it was the right decision otherwise what's to stop him from doing it in future without consequence. 
        
            
        <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity</h3>
        Being part Maori I think has influenced me a lot, I feel like i'm pretty laid back about most things, enjoy the beach, walking barefoot and love seafood. My Dad has had a huge impact on my sporting life especially as he taught me from a young age to play football which I was quite good at thanks to him. Both my parents are very caring for their family and friends which I feel like I‚Äôve inherited with how I look out for my siblings and friends.
        
        
        <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
        I'm very persistent when I put my mind to something which I think is a great trait to have when having to work through things on my own like the sprints i'm working on atm. I'm a good problem solver being able to work through solutions and think out the problem and look for the best way forward which is great for coding. I'm also a quick learner and pick things up quickly which is great for learning new skills like coding.
        
        <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
        I struggle to ask for help if I get stuck. I often spend too much time trying to solve a problem instead of asking someone for help, which is a bad habit that slows me down too much. Can also affect me looking for a job if I need some help on my cv but haven't asked for help. If things are too tedious I can get distracted if i'm not testing my brain, i need to keep my engagement up and keep testing myself on new code and projects so i can keep learning.

        <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        Trying to cook at home with my siblings, they often like to stand around and do nothing while we cook, if you leave them to figure out what to do by themselves they come to the conclusion that nothing needs to be done. I tried to tell them to figure out what needs doing but that didn't work so I ended up figuring out a job I could give each of them to help. This worked great as they did not have an excuse that they didn't know what to do. In future i think i'd try asking them beforehand to plan what needs to be done for the meal to be cooked and they can go through step by step.
