                <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
A programming interface where we can change things inside the document such as structure, style and content represented as nodes and objects so we can interact with them. The DOM is not a JS language but instead a web API to build websites. While the DOM is usually used with JS it can be built for any language. An example of this interaction would be when submitting a form when you click the submit button the dom takes in the data and gives back a result usually something like signing you in or completing an order.<br>

<h3>Arrays and Objects.</h3>
To access data from an object we use dot notation
 // Example 'person' object <br>
var person = {<br>
 name: ‚ÄòThomas‚Äô,<br>
 age: 25,<br>
};<br>
For example if we wanted to change my name in the data from Thomas to Alex we would use person.name=‚ÄôAlex‚Äô, this can also be done using bracket notation e,g,
person['age'] // returns 25
We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable as they are very useful at holding and manipulating all the items. They are  accessed using  zero-based indexing e.g., if i wanted to access Wellington in let nzTowns=[‚ÄòWellington‚Äô, ‚ÄòAuckland‚Äô,‚ÄôHamilton‚Äô] we would write nzTowns[0].
<h3>Functions</h3>
Functions are a set of instructions to achieve an outcome. They are a way we can reduce code by just calling on the function to do it for us. Often functions will take in a parameter and return an output we can use for example 
<h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
HTML is the canvas the painter works on while CSS is the outlines painted on the canvas and Javascript is the colours painted on last. 
<h3>Flow and loops</h3> flow is the order that code executes and is a vital part of any programming project. For example when putting shoes on the order is:<br>
Put socks on<br>
Put foot in shoe<br>
Tie laces<br>
If we were to do number 3 first it messes up our execution and we get a different result then the one we want.
Loops are how we can repeat a process multiple times for example on a music playlist the music loop ends when we reach the end of the playlist and there isn't any more songs to play.
