                <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                Emotional intelligence or EQ is being able to understand, use, manage and handle emotions not only your emotions but of those around you as well. There are 5 key parts of EQ self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Self awareness is being able to understand your own emotions and how they affect your actions and moods. self-regulation is managing and accepting emotions while waiting
                for the right time to express them. Those that are motivated look for rewards outside of money and fame
                they insteak seek to accomplish their own goals. Empathy is being able to listen and try to relate to
                someone else's perspective, this helps build relationships with others. Social skills is the ability to
                put the understanding of emotions into action by building relationships with your colleagues.
                <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
                Eq is related to how we sense emotion in ourselves and others, whereas IQ is your own intellectual
                ability. EQ affects our day to day with how we interact with others and is how we are able to build
                relationships with other people. IQ is generally agreed upon as something that can‚Äôt be improved through
                study while EQ can be improved upon with training and exercises. Intellectual ability is how well
                someone can use information and logic to answer questions.
                <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
                Emotional intelligence is important because it shapes our lives at work and how we deal with both our
                own emotions and those around us. It helps us better understand coworkers feelings and ideas and how we
                can respond to them. It also helps us better understand our own emotions and how we can convey them to
                others in an appropriate manner.
