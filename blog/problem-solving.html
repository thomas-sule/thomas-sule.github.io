        <h4>
        Technical Blog - Problem Solving
        </h4>
        <p>
        
        <h3>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
            <h4>what was the problem?</h4>
            Using the exported flipflop function, I was trying to use a function I had made in a different file and export it so I could use the function in a different file.
            <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
            Rubber duck, which is where you talk to a ‚Äúrubber duck‚Äù, basically saying the problem outloud to help understand the problem and think of solutions.
            <h4>how did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
            Frustrated, can get flustered if I‚Äôm stuck on the same problem for an extended period of time.
            <h4>what did you learn?</h4>
            To relax and take my time to look over it, and how to use the function from one file in another.
            <h3>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
            <h4>what was the problem?</h4>
            Stuck making gradebook students, needed to figure out how to create objects for a gradebook that would have the students scores in them.
            <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
            Used console.log to see what it was returning, basically prints out what was inside the gradebook to figure out how i could put the students in correctly
            <h4>how did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
            Frustrated couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong
            <h4>what did you learn?</h4>
            Console.log is the best and how to create the key and empty object.
            <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
            Pseudocode: Haven‚Äôt used enough yet<br>
            Trying something: Pretty good <br>
            Rubber ducky method: Good I like saying aloud what's wrong incase I can pick up what wrong while talking<br>
            Reading error messages: Good can be useful to figure out exactly where and what is going wrong <br>
            Console.logging: Good super handy to see what I‚Äôve put into functions and objects etc.<br>
            Googling: Pretty good, still a bit tricky wording exactly what I want.<br>
            Asking your peers for help: ok usually just google <br>
            Asking coaches for help: Alright will ask if i'm stuck for a while<br>
            Improving your process with reflection: Should do them immediately after I finish so I don't have to try to remember as much.<br>
            <h4>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h4>
            
            Don't like being behind where I should be up to. Just get over it and ask for help.
