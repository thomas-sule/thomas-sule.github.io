       <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        I wanna work in the I.T sector not so that I‚Äôm able to travel one day and use my skills overseas. I also have a sore back so I need to work somewhere I can sit down.
        
        <h3>description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        Persistent when it comes to solving problems. I‚Äôm able to pick up things pretty quickly but struggle to concentrate over long periods of time. I often take a break if I get distracted or not focused.
        <h3>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        Being more open with people I'm working with, being able to utilize my time more efficiently to get work done.
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
        I will dedicate the right amount of time each day to make sure I get all my work done. Would mean I‚Äôm consistently getting up around 8 and starting each day at the same time. Making sure I‚Äôm focused while I need to study, which mean I have to catch myself when I‚Äôm losing focus and get back on track. Reaching out when I need help in the discord.
        <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
        Ask for help through discord.
       <h3> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        I will seek help when I need help either from my facilitator or on discord. 
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        To be easy to talk to and helpful with any questions. Giving good feedback if I‚Äôve done something wrong or need help.
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
        Will have to plan ahead and make sure any commitments I make I will have done the work required beforehand.
        <h3>------------</h3>


<h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

Find work in the IT sector so that I‚Äôm able to use my skills overseas preferably somewhere like Japan. Give my back a break from labor work.        
        
 <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
Pretty good at problem solving if I‚Äôm stuck. Good at keeping focused for long periods. Using my breaks well.
        
<h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
Speaking in front of a group I find pretty tough. Mostly just things I have to infront of others.        
        
<h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
Talking in front of groups and developing some leadership skills.
<h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
Helpful feedback for any questions about the course and coding problems.
<h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
Making sure I‚Äôm getting enough rest to be able to function properly for the day. Making my plans to fit around bootcamp when I'll be free. Asking for help with anything I might need ASAP.
