            Human Skills Reflection
        </h4>
        <p>
            <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>
            Pretty stoked when I complete a whole project </li>
            <li>
            Can get down on myself if I‚Äôm struggling for a while
            </li>
            <li>
            Like relating to others about struggling with certain parts
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>
            Values dictate our lives and how we approach problems in terms of learning, we can value different aspects above others such as appearance or functionality. </li>
            <li>
            Empathy helps in relating to others what we learn and program so we are on the same page and can help each other come to the right decision.
            </li>
            <li>
            Self-awareness is key for understanding not only your emotions but those around you so we are able to convey our ideas in an appropriate manner. Is also key for our own learning to understand when we are frustrated what we need to do to get back to the right learning place.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
            The impact of consistent self reflection on learning.<br>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
            Having to talk about myself.<br>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
            Because it's so important to learning and day to day life to be able to have the right human skills to interact with colleagues and skills to learn a lot in a short amount of time.<br>
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            No because we need to learn a lot of skills in a short time have to be in the best mental shape we can be to maximize our learning, and it's an important skill for work to understand and relate with colleagues
