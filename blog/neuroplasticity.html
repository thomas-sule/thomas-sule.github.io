        Neuroplasticity

        <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
        People that are told and understand neuroplasticity have shown in studies that their morale and grades increase significantly. Students are more motivated to study when they understand that they are able to train and change their brain.
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
        Learning and practicing new things will help me build stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain. Putting new info learnt into context of my day to day life then im able to achieve more successful long-term memory storage and retrieval.
        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        Put information that I'm learning into context by integrating new skills and info in day to day life. Practice is vital to ingraining the connections in your brain.

        <h3>What is a growth mindset and why it is relevant.</h3>
        A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities are not fixed and that they can be improved upon through effort, learning and perseverance. Those with a growth mindset tend to worry less about looking smart and put more energy into learning. It's relevant as if we believe that we are at our max capacity for abilities then we aren't able to work on and improve new skills and we'd be stuck with what we know forever.
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        Not really it makes sense that if we are open and willing to put effort into practicing and learning new skills we would gradually improve them.
        
        <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
        By practicing over and over the skills in learning and trying to relate them to day to day life.<br>

        <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
        Will need to spend more time practicing the skills I've been learning. Keep an open mind to learning new skills. Relating more to my day to day life.
